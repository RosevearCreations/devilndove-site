# Build 177 handoff note

This build adds release-readiness scoring, Cloudflare deployment import support, exact manifest diff rows, Product QA approval controls, recall notification lock enforcement, LocalBusiness JSON-LD bake support, and the Build 177 D1 migration. Run migrations in order through `database_build177_deploy_score_and_controls.sql`, then run Deployment Preflight and Release Control before promotion.

# Current Build Status — Build 174

Latest pass added richer Deployment Preflight detail, D1 schema diff, migration planner, Markdown export, post-deploy confirmations, release package hash manifest, dashboard preflight badge, and regenerated sanity/release documentation.

D1 order remains:

1. `database_build171_ledger_repair.sql` only if Build 171 schema exists but its ledger marker is missing.
2. `database_build173_deployment_preflight.sql`.
3. `database_build174_deployment_preflight_detail.sql`.

# Build 173 Current Status

Latest packaged work adds Deployment Preflight safety for Devil n Dove:
- `/admin/deployment-preflight/`
- `/api/admin/deployment-preflight`
- `database_build173_deployment_preflight.sql`
- static `scripts/deployment_preflight_static_check.py`
- `data/site/deployment-preflight.json`

The main operational risk reduced here is accidentally rerunning a large D1 upgrade after the Build 171 schema changes already applied but the ledger marker failed. The correct repair order is documented in README, SANITY_HEALTH_CHECK, DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE, and RELEASE_NOTES.

# Build 159 note

Catalog Product Editor image UX was repaired: existing saved images now appear as draggable thumbnail cards in Product pictures, the first card syncs to the featured image, gallery URL slots are de-duplicated from the featured image, and advanced media metadata remains in Product Media Workflow. No schema migration required for this front-end pass.

# Build 156 AI context update

The current Devil n Dove build now includes a safer custom commerce path: request → quote → line items → accepted follow-through → converted order → strict payment-share gate → private payment page → provider checkout preparation → private order-status page → post-fulfillment consent response. Custom candle and soap landing pages now feed into the same Custom Request intake. Marketplace export packs now include CSV downloads, and product detail pages can show related proof-matched products.

When continuing work, preserve the review-first rule: do not auto-send, auto-charge, auto-publish, or auto-use customer images publicly without explicit admin review and consent.

# Build 154 AI handoff

Latest completed pass: Build 154. The build now connects accepted private custom quote previews to review-needed payment-request and order-draft records. Quote drafts have editable line items, calculated material/labour/pickup-shipping/tax/total estimates, and revision history. Customer reference uploads now create media consent records as requested/internal-only. Accounting close can produce an accountant ZIP. Approved SEO overrides can be baked into static HTML from `data/site/seo-page-overrides.json` with `scripts/bake_approved_seo_overrides.py`. The public gallery now filters by product type, material, process, and locality.

Next best work: convert reviewed payment-request drafts to real payment links, convert reviewed order drafts to real orders, add quote revision resend/version links, add marketplace export packs, and extend proof filters into shop/product APIs.

# Build 153 AI context update

The current build adds private custom quote preview links and post-submit custom-request reference image uploads. The important new assets are `/api/custom-request-quote`, `/custom-request/quote/`, `/public/js/custom-request-quote-preview.js`, `/api/custom-request-reference-upload`, and updated Operations > Custom Requests actions. Quote acceptance/decline is intent tracking only; it does not charge the customer or create a real order yet. Reference images are private-review-only until media consent/public-use review is added.

# Build 152 AI context update

The latest build pass turns custom requests into a more complete quote/payment workflow and adds HST/GST reminder support. Important implementation notes:

- `/api/admin/custom-requests` now creates manual customer reply templates from quote drafts. These are copy/review templates only; nothing is auto-sent.
- Custom requests can now create deposit and invoice candidate rows in `custom_request_payment_candidates`. These are internal candidates only until a future payment-request/invoice module connects them to real billing.
- Operations > Custom Requests now shows reply template text, copy buttons, deposit candidates, and invoice candidates.
- `/api/admin/accounting-close-workflow` can queue an HST/GST reminder into `notification_outbox` using the saved reminder date and admin/accounting destination.
- Active schema SQL files include `custom_request_reply_templates`, `custom_request_payment_candidates`, and reminder-safe `notification_outbox` support.

Continue keeping docs/schema files current in every pass and preserve one H1 per exposed public page.

# Build 151 AI context update

The latest build pass adds Custom Request conversion and campaign attribution improvements. Important implementation notes:

- Operations now actually mounts the Custom Requests admin panel.
- `/api/admin/custom-requests` now creates internal planning records in `custom_request_quote_drafts`, `custom_request_job_drafts`, and `custom_request_product_drafts` instead of only updating request status.
- `/api/custom-request` now captures UTM fields plus visitor/session tokens from `DDAnalytics`.
- `/api/track/visit` now self-heals UTM columns on visitor sessions and page views and records campaign values.
- `/api/admin/social-post-queue` now joins UTM queue rows to traffic/session/custom-request conversion counts when those analytics tables exist.
- Accounting close workflow can emit a CSV through `/api/admin/accounting-close-workflow?period_month=YYYY-MM&format=csv`.

Continue keeping docs/schema files current in every pass and preserve one H1 per public page.

# Build 150 AI context

Build 150 starts from the Build 149 media/custom/social baseline and adds the next workflow layer:

- Operations now has an approved testimonial/local trust block workflow backed by D1 (`trust_block_items`).
- Public trust/testimonial blocks try `/api/trust-blocks` first and fall back to featured product reviews if no trust rows are approved yet.
- Search Console opportunity actions can now be applied into `seo_page_overrides` for reviewed title/meta/internal-link fallback use.
- Public pages load `/public/js/seo-page-overrides.js` so approved override records can enhance title/meta/internal-link notes without breaking pages when D1 is empty.
- Accounting now has a Close Workflow panel for payment application, HST/GST review, month-end close readiness, and accountant export manifest packaging.
- Release Sanity and Public API Health now check the new trust, SEO override, and accounting close tables/endpoints.

Next priorities: custom request -> quote/job/product draft conversion, visitor/session conversion joins for social UTM rollups, static-build baking of approved SEO overrides, and downloadable accountant export bundles.

# Build 149 AI context

The latest pass focused on the outstanding sanity-check list for Devil n Dove:

- Product readiness/review now checks missing image roles, hero/front role, and blocked/consent-needed public-use status.
- Product Story Notes now depend on story privacy status plus product media consent summaries before approved/published states are allowed.
- Product Media Workflow now includes simple browser-side crop/resize upload presets.
- Public product detail image output is role-aware and filters blocked/consent-needed media.
- Public `/custom-request/` plus Operations > Custom Requests now capture/review custom engraving, personalized gift, jewelry, sublimation, and workshop-made requests.
- Social Posting Queue caption templates are admin-editable and UTM campaign rollups are visible.

When continuing, prioritize testimonial/local trust workflow, custom request -> quote/job/product draft conversion, Search Console reviewed-action application, and the accounting close/export work.

# AI Context — Devil n Dove

## Build 140 working context

The current build adds safer social publishing controls: dry-run platform payload previews, scheduled post blocking, per-platform caption variants, duplicate/repost guardrails, media warnings, and social Release Sanity checks. Keep social API secrets in Cloudflare environment variables only. Never store tokens in D1, Markdown, JSON, or public assets.


## Build 139 working context

The current build adds approved social API publishing attempts to Operations > Social Posting Queue. Keep all credentials in Cloudflare environment variables only. Do not place platform tokens in D1, JSON files, Markdown, or public assets. Facebook/Instagram/X/Pinterest are API-attempt capable when configured; TikTok/YouTube remain manual/review-first until their upload workflows are explicitly built.

Build 137 extends the Search Console workflow. The current admin flow is: import Search Console CSV privately, filter page/query opportunities, optionally delete/revert a bad import batch, then generate private `seo_opportunity_actions` for human-reviewed title/meta/internal-link tasks. Nothing edits public SEO copy automatically. Keep one H1 per exposed page, maintain local Ontario wording where relevant, and keep private CSV/order/import files out of public `/data/`.

## Build 135 AI handoff

The latest pass focuses on product media workflow: R2/media diagnostics, product image health, draft checklist, reusable image library, edit-mode upload attachment, and update-product persistence for origin/channel/external listing fields. Continue to treat uploaded Amazon/order files as private and keep public `/data/` free of order details.


Current sync: 2026-05-18 — Build 137 Search Console filtering, safe batch revert, and private SEO opportunity action queue.

Devil n Dove is a Southern Ontario maker/storefront project with handmade jewelry, polymer clay, resin, laser engraving, sublimation, workshop tools/supplies, vintage/collectible finds, and admin/accounting workflows.

## Current technical direction
- Cloudflare Pages + Pages Functions.
- Cloudflare D1 as the long-term operational database.
- JSON is still used as seed/fallback/static bridge data, but DB-first workflows are preferred for inventory, catalog, accounting, and admin-managed content.
- Money is stored as cents in D1 and displayed as dollars in admin UI.
- Tools and supplies currently owned by the shop default to at least one stock unit.
- Consumables use package math: one stock package can contain many usage units.

## Build 125 focus
- Amazon purchase review/apply workflow for private staging rows.
- Inventory unit-cost history.
- Reconciliation exception queue actions.
- Journal validation/posting guardrails.
- Local-intent SEO pages and sitemap.

## Strong guardrails
- Do not deploy raw Amazon order reports publicly.
- Update Markdown and schema files each pass.
- Keep one H1 per exposed HTML page.
- Prefer D1 for authoritative operational data.
- Keep robust fallbacks and admin-visible error states.

## Build 126 AI context

The current hotfix focus is runtime incident visibility. The app now has a visible admin Runtime Incidents panel, grouped `/api/admin/runtime-incidents` output, review status fields, and Release Sanity excludes resolved/ignored error or critical incidents from the 7-day warning.


## Build 127 context

The latest hotfix addresses `/api/products` runtime incidents. Do not assume D1 optional columns exist in public endpoints. Build SQL from `PRAGMA table_info` results when referencing optional product/tax/SEO fields. In D1/SQLite, a missing column inside `COALESCE()` still breaks the query.

## Build 128 context

The latest hotfix target is the public product API schema drift. Build 127 still produced a live `/api/products` error for `p.merchandise_origin`. Build 128 fixes this by verifying optional columns with `SELECT column FROM table LIMIT 0` before building SQL. `/api/product-detail` was also hardened because it used similar optional product/tax/SEO fields.


## Build 129 context

When continuing this project, remember that Operations now includes D1 Schema Drift Report and Public API Health. Use those before assuming runtime errors are fixed. Amazon CSV data should be imported through the private admin staging flow, reviewed, then applied to inventory; never deploy raw order/cost spreadsheets in public `/data/` folders.

## Build 130 AI handoff note

When continuing this project, remember that `/api/products` must remain schema-drift tolerant. Do not add optional product columns directly to public product SQL unless they are proven by strict D1 metadata checks. If product richness fails, prefer public-safe fallback data over a storefront outage.

## Build 131 AI handoff

Current focus: stabilize the Devil n Dove storefront against D1 schema drift. Build 131 adds `/api/admin/storefront-schema-repair` plus an Operations UI to inspect/apply non-destructive product/tax/product SEO compatibility columns. It also expands Public API Health and adds local predeploy sanity checks. Future work should continue product value backfills, structured-data checks, sitemap generation from D1, Amazon review safeguards, and accounting close/export workflows.

## Build 132 AI handoff

The latest pass is Build 132. Main user request: the mobile main menu was too long. The fix is in `/js/main.js` and `/css/styles.css`: shared nav now renders desktop links separately and mobile grouped accordions with quick buttons. `scripts/predeploy_sanity_check.py` now checks mobile-nav assets. No D1 schema change is required except the ledger marker in `database_upgrade_current_pass.sql`.

## Build 133 AI handoff

The current build includes Operations panels and endpoints for Structured Data Health, Storefront Value Backfill, and Live Sitemap Preview. The compact mobile menu from Build 132 must be preserved. The next AI pass should continue with Search Console CSV import UI, Amazon duplicate/relink hardening, and accounting close workflow expansion.


## Build 134 note

This pass fixes the Product editor draft workflow: drafts require only name/type, image upload is available from the editor when R2 media storage is configured, create-product failures return JSON instead of HTML 500 pages, and the create endpoint adapts to live D1 product/media/SEO columns.

## Build 136 status — 2026-05-18

- Added Operations > Search Console CSV Import.
- Added `/api/admin/search-console-import` for private D1 staging of Search Console CSV exports.
- Added top-page and SEO-opportunity summaries for manual title/meta/internal-link review.
- Added Release Sanity coverage and current-pass SQL table/index self-healing for the Search Console staging tables.
- Keep Search Console CSV exports private; do not store them in public `/data/`.

Next deployment checks: apply/record `database_upgrade_current_pass.sql`, open `/admin/operations/`, import a tiny Search Console CSV sample, then run Release Sanity and Public API Health.


## Build 138 AI handoff note

The site now has a review-first Social Posting Queue. Keep future social work safe: manual/copy-ready first, OAuth/API diagnostics second, direct publishing last. Never store platform secrets in public files or D1; use Cloudflare environment variables for secrets.

## Build 141 AI handoff

The current social workflow is review-first. Do not recommend blind auto-posting. Social queue now supports caption templates, content pillars, calls to action, UTM-tagged links, calendar summary, dry run, scheduling, duplicate guards, and API attempts only when Cloudflare environment variables exist. Future work should add an admin template editor, social analytics rollups, and job/customer media privacy controls before more automation.


## Build 142 update — Competitive roadmap completed and tracked

- Completed `COMPETITIVE.md` as the active competitive strategy for Devil n Dove, covering positioning, homepage/product-page improvements, mobile UX, local SEO, social workflow, marketplace readiness, product media, trust, and accounting/margin direction.
- Added Operations > Competitive Roadmap so the highest-value items from the document can be seeded into D1, assigned a status, and reviewed during Release Sanity.
- Added `competitive_opportunities` and `competitive_opportunity_events` schema support.
- Added `/data/site/competitive-opportunities.json` as a public-safe roadmap seed file; it contains strategy/action metadata only and no private costs, orders, or customer data.
- Next direction: connect competitive opportunities to product readiness, SEO action completion, social analytics, testimonials, custom requests, and marketplace export checks.


## Build 143 — Social Media Privacy Guard + Competitive Execution

Completed in this pass:

1. Added Operations > Social Media Privacy Guard.
2. Added `/api/admin/social-media-privacy-guard`.
3. Added `social_media_privacy_rules` and `social_post_privacy_reviews` schema support.
4. Added default rules for customer/private identifiers, workshop background leaks, product-only media, personal wording review, and visible children/visitors.
5. Added privacy columns to `social_post_queue` through runtime-safe self-healing.
6. Blocked API publishing from Social Posting Queue until the queued post is privacy-approved or marked no-private-media.
7. Added Release Sanity checks for the Social Media Privacy Guard endpoint and open posts needing privacy review.
8. Expanded `COMPETITIVE.md` with competitive execution details, product-page direction, social calendar, trust/privacy posture, marketplace direction, accounting/margin priorities, and immediate/next/later implementation waves.
9. Expanded `data/site/competitive-opportunities.json` with social privacy, product story, and local trust block opportunities.
10. Updated schema files and active Markdown handoff docs.

Next strongest directions:

1. Render product-story blocks publicly on product detail pages.
2. Add a reusable local trust block to Home, About, Shop, Contact, product, and local pages.
3. Add “post this product” from Product editor into Social Posting Queue.
4. Add admin-editable caption templates.
5. Add social analytics rollups from UTM links and manual/API post URLs.
6. Add product media role checklist: main/detail/scale/process/packaging/video.
7. Add customer media consent records for job/customer-specific posts.
8. Add testimonials/review approval workflow.
9. Add marketplace export readiness checks.
10. Continue payment application, HST review, period close, and accountant export packaging.

## Build 144 note

Build 144 adds public product storytelling, a reusable Southern Ontario trust block, and a Product editor shortcut that queues product-based social posts for review. Keep social posting privacy-gated and keep public `/data/` files free of private costs, orders, customer records, and credentials.

## Build 146 AI context

The next assistant should know:

- The user reported `/api/admin/mobile-create-product` failed with `normalizeColorNames is not defined`; Build 146 replaces the endpoint with a fixed version.
- Product editor draft autosave and seven-image upload are active expectations.
- Product Story Notes were added as an admin-managed workflow for `product_story_public_notes`.
- Story notes are public-facing only after review and should avoid private/customer/sensitive workshop details.
- Next priorities include story snippets on shop cards, image ordering/role checklist, social consent records, social analytics, and the accounting close workflow.



## Build 147 AI handoff

The current working direction is: product capture should flow from quick draft → multi-image/product-role review → approved public story → shop-card story snippet → social queue → privacy/consent review. The new media consent registry is private D1 data and must not be placed in public `/data/` files.


## Build 148 AI Context

Continue treating product media as role-aware and privacy-aware. Product images can now carry `image_role`, `public_use_status`, `consent_record_id`, and `role_review_notes`. Social Privacy Guard checks Media Consent Records for customer/private media before approval. Internal site search should keep using approved product story snippets.

## Build 155 update - custom request follow-through, marketplace packs, and proof filters

- Custom requests now have a safer end-to-end path from intake to quote preview, quote revision link, reviewed payment request link, real order draft conversion, marketplace export pack, and post-fulfillment review/photo/consent prompt.
- Public payment review pages are private/noindex pages and do not process cards automatically; they record customer readiness and keep the final payment method under admin review.
- Product/shop APIs now expose proof filter fields for material, process, and locality so public filtering is not limited to the gallery page.
- Schema files were updated for the new custom request payment link, marketplace export, and fulfillment prompt tables.

## Build 157 update — payment readiness, link controls, stages, candle/soap specs, marketplace presets, and consent proof review

Completed in this pass:

- Hardened `/api/admin/mobile-create-product` so Save Partial retries duplicate SKU/product-number/slug conflicts and returns a recoverable JSON response instead of a raw D1 500 when identity generation collides.
- Added admin link lifecycle controls for custom quote, payment, order-status, and consent links: resend marker, expire, and void.
- Added customer custom-order stage tracking for planning, making, curing/finishing, ready, shipped/pickup, and complete.
- Added candle/soap intake fields for scent profile, wax/base, colour notes, batch, ingredient notes, and allergen/safety notes.
- Added `custom_candle_soap_product_specs` so candle/soap details can be tracked outside the general message text and later linked to product drafts or finished products.
- Added marketplace channel presets and richer CSV rows for Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Pinterest, and manual listings, including category and shipping-profile review fields.
- Added payment provider readiness records for Stripe, PayPal, and Square configuration checks. This records configuration readiness only; real production checkout still requires a live low-value test order with credentials in Cloudflare.
- Added consent-to-public-proof candidates and an admin approval action that can turn an approved response into a public trust block.
- Updated private order-status pages to show custom work stage history.
- Updated schema files and handoff Markdown for the new workflow.

Next strongest steps:

1. Add editable UI fields for candle/soap scent, wax/base, colour, batch, ingredients, allergen/safety notes, and cure-ready date inside product drafts and mobile product capture.
2. Add explicit Stripe/PayPal/Square live-test result buttons after production credentials are configured in Cloudflare.
3. Add per-link customer copy templates for resend actions so quote/payment/order/consent links can be manually resent with consistent wording.
4. Add public-safe trust block moderation filters so approved consent proof can be scheduled by page/context.
5. Add stage-specific customer messages for custom work: planning, making, curing/finishing, ready, and shipped/pickup.
6. Add marketplace preset editing UI instead of relying on seeded defaults.

## Build 158 — Catalog action and image workflow repair

- Added `IMAGES.md` with the complete image/video placement checklist, required sizes, allowed video use, target paths/data fields, and product image role workflow.
- Repaired `/admin/catalog/` so it now includes the full product editor form required by Edit, product picker, image fields, SEO fields, marketplace fields, and the media/resource modules.
- Changed Product table Approve/Publish buttons so they are clickable even when blocked; the backend now returns the exact missing fields instead of silently doing nothing through a disabled button.
- Improved Needs Changes so admins are prompted for what needs changing and that note can be saved into the product review history/readiness notes.
- Hardened product review actions by ensuring support tables exist before review/publish checks run and by returning human-readable readiness labels.
- Repaired Reserve Resources and Release Resources UI feedback so it handles the actual inventory API response shape and reports affected, skipped/story-only, and missing inventory links.
- Improved Product Media Workflow so loading a product for editing auto-loads its image rows, each row shows a thumbnail, Delete image row is clearer, and saving an empty image set clears `featured_image_url`.
- Continued SEO/H1 discipline: one H1 per scanned public page, private/admin pages kept separate from public SEO goals, and local/product image guidance documented.

### Build 158 next steps

1. Add admin dashboard counters for products missing hero image, missing image roles, missing alt text, blocked public-use status, and missing OG image.
2. Add static example images for custom candle making, custom soap making, custom requests, and About/workshop story.
3. Add a backend endpoint that returns product readiness blockers separately from review actions so the UI can show a checklist before clicking Approve/Publish.
4. Add CSV/export image validation for Etsy/Facebook/Pinterest before marketplace export.
5. Add video poster image fields to product story notes and custom candle/soap pages.

## Build 160 — Catalog editor URL validation and publish image sync repair

- Fixed the Product Editor canonical URL field so relative site paths such as `/shop/product/?slug=desert-succulents-100` are accepted. The input is now text with helper guidance instead of browser `type=url` validation.
- Clarified External Listing URL: leave it blank for normal Devil n Dove shop products; only add a full `https://` Etsy/Facebook/marketplace URL when Sale Channel is Hybrid or External-only.
- Hardened update/create product image syncing so the featured image is also stored in `product_images` at sort order 0, gallery rows follow after it, duplicates are removed, and existing image rows/annotations are preserved when the URL already exists.
- Fixed Clear editor so the visual image cards and Product Media Workflow panel clear along with the form fields.
- Improved publish/approve readiness consistency by making the editor’s image fields and backend `product_images` rows agree before review actions run.
- No new D1 table is required in this pass; this is a code/data-sync behavior repair against the existing products, product_images, product_seo, and product_image_annotations tables.

Next recommended checks:
1. Edit a product with a relative canonical path and click Update Product.
2. Confirm External Listing URL is blank for normal onsite listings.
3. Save, reload, and confirm the first visual image is the featured image and appears in Product Media Workflow.
4. Run Approve/Publish; any blocker should now be a real readiness issue such as missing image role, missing SEO, missing price, or blocked public-use status.

## Build 161 — shop image/gallery, product detail JSON fallback, and catalog workspace split

- Repaired the public product detail page so an HTML fallback response from `/api/product-detail` no longer throws a raw `Unexpected token '<'` JSON error in the browser. The page now reads the response as text, detects HTML, and falls back to `/api/products` by slug when possible.
- Hardened `functions/api/product-detail.js` with a final JSON error wrapper so late D1/query failures return JSON instead of a static HTML error page.
- Extended `/api/products` to attach product image arrays from `product_images`, allowing shop cards to show a main image plus selectable thumbnail images.
- Updated the Shop product card UI so cards are more compact, show richer product details, and allow thumbnail clicks to change the main product image.
- CSS-polished the Shop “Browse by collection direction” area and the `/creations/` collection/trust grid so the layouts are less cramped and more mobile-safe.
- Split the oversized `/admin/catalog/` workflow into focused workspaces: Products & Publishing, Media & Product Images, and Tools & Supplies Inventory Operations.
- Added `/admin/catalog-media/` for media, image roles, image annotations, SEO, and product story work.
- Added `/admin/inventory-operations/` for tools, supplies, stock, product resource reservations, catalog sync, option sets, notifications, and app settings.
- Capped the Product Editor file picker to six selected uploads at a time while preserving existing product-image slots.
- Made the Product Media Workflow more compact by moving advanced crop/quality/scoring fields into a collapsible advanced section.

Next recommended steps: add a dedicated readiness-preview endpoint for product publishing blockers, add image health counters to the admin dashboard, and add live test notes after deploying Build 161.

## Build 162 — Shop/Creations CSS, Gift Page, and Inventory Image References

- Added `/gift-cards/` as a dedicated public gift-card page so the main shop no longer has the full gift-card form awkwardly placed between filters and products.
- Changed `/shop/` to show a compact gift-card callout that links to `/gift-cards/`.
- Repaired the contrast for the `/shop/` Browse by collection direction panel and the `/creations/` browse/filter/cards areas so light panels use dark readable text.
- Updated Tools & Supplies Inventory Operations to show a live visual image preview beside the Image URL field while keeping the URL editable.
- Updated the inventory list rows to show a larger thumbnail, the image URL link, and the source/Amazon URL link for easier visual reference.
- Added `/gift-cards/` to the sitemap. No D1 schema migration is required for this pass.


## Build 163 — 20-step roadmap/gaps pass: readiness, image health, gifts, and admin clarity

Completed in this pass:

1. Added `/admin/readiness/` as a focused Product Readiness workspace.
2. Added `/api/admin/product-readiness` so Approve/Publish blockers can be previewed before clicking action buttons.
3. Added readiness summary counters for total, ready, blocked, missing featured image, missing image roles, missing alt text, blocked public-use images, missing SEO, missing price, and products needing 3 images.
4. Added per-product blocker cards with direct links back to the product editor and media workspace.
5. Added dashboard counters for product image/SEO readiness gaps.
6. Added a Product Readiness department card to the Admin Dashboard.
7. Added Readiness Preview links to Catalog, Catalog Media, and Inventory Operations workspace navigation.
8. Added a static gift-card artwork placeholder at `/assets/gift-card-placeholder.svg`.
9. Added gift-card artwork guidance directly to the `/gift-cards/` hero.
10. Added Gift Cards to the home navigation so the new gift page is easier to find.
11. Hardened predeploy sanity checks so the new readiness page, endpoint, dashboard counters, gift artwork, and CSS assets are checked every pass.
12. Added CSS for readiness cards, readiness score badges, blocker rows, and the split gift-card hero.
13. Kept the one-H1 rule intact across all scanned exposed pages.
14. Kept private/admin pages as `noindex,nofollow` where appropriate.
15. Continued the local SEO habit of clear titles, readable headings, and visible local/product wording.
16. Kept the new readiness endpoint D1-backed without adding a required migration.
17. Preserved the split admin structure from the previous pass: Products, Media, Inventory Operations, and now Readiness.
18. Improved operator visibility before publishing by making missing image roles, missing hero/detail/scale roles, public-use blockers, SEO gaps, and price gaps visible from one place.
19. Updated active Markdown handoff docs with Build 163 notes.
20. Updated schema/reference SQL notes with Build 163 status and no-migration guidance.

Next 20 recommended steps:

1. Add inline readiness badges beside each row in the `/admin/catalog/` product table.
2. Add a one-click “Open first blocker” shortcut from each readiness card.
3. Add image-role quick-fix buttons from the readiness page.
4. Add automatic “apply recommended roles” preview before saving image rows.
5. Add true crop/focal-point visual editing directly on thumbnail cards.
6. Add visible “image order saved” confirmation that shows featured/gallery order after save.
7. Add dashboard drilldown links from each image/SEO counter.
8. Add gift-card admin settings for default amounts, expiry wording, and active/inactive status.
9. Add a real gift-card image upload field and replace the placeholder artwork.
10. Add gift-card checkout order-line creation instead of only local draft storage.
11. Add marketplace image validation before CSV export.
12. Add channel-specific marketplace CSV presets editing in admin.
13. Add shop/product API filters for “missing proof image” and “ready for social.”
14. Add post-publish QA for product detail JSON, image gallery, cart button, and SEO preview.
15. Add public product page mini-gallery thumbnails below the main image if any product detail page still only shows one image.
16. Add public proof/trust moderation filters before new trust blocks appear customer-facing.
17. Add order-stage photo uploads for custom work: planning, making, curing/finishing, ready, pickup/shipping.
18. Add candle/soap spec editing after product creation: scent, wax/base, colour, ingredients, allergens, and batch number.
19. Add accountant export checks for missing evidence URLs and missing close notes.
20. Add a mobile admin landing page that links to phone capture, inventory intake, readiness blockers, and today’s admin actions.


## Build 164 — Roadmap/Gaps Pass Completed

Completed from the requested next-20 pass:

1. Added inline readiness badges beside each product row in `/admin/catalog/`.
2. Added one-click **Open blocker** shortcuts from product rows and readiness cards.
3. Added image-role quick-fix buttons from `/admin/readiness/` that apply recommended image roles through the Product Media Workflow endpoint.
4. Added recommended image-role preview before saving image rows.
5. Added click-to-set focal point editing directly on Product Media Workflow thumbnail cards.
6. Added visible “Product images and image order saved” confirmation after saving image rows.
7. Added Admin Dashboard drilldown links from readiness counters into `/admin/readiness/?filter=...`.
