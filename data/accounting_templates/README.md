# Build 225 current accounting note

Launch accounting status is tracked in `/admin/startup-readiness/`. Before controlled opening, prove payment application, HST/GST review, refund/tax reversal, reconciliation, role-restricted accountant export, and the temporary month-end procedure. Current schema and roadmap authority are `DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md`; older notes below remain historical implementation evidence.

---

# Build 156 accounting/template note

Build 156 did not change close CSV math, but custom request payments now create provider checkout preparation records. Future accountant exports should include `custom_request_payment_checkout_records`, `custom_request_payment_links`, and related `payments` rows when custom work is paid through Stripe, PayPal, Square, or manual fallback.

# Accounting Templates

Current sync: 2026-05-14 — Build 125.

## Purpose
This folder holds safe accounting template/reference files. Private statement exports, Amazon CSVs, accountant packages, and receipts should not be deployed publicly.

## Current statement provider profile support
The admin app now has saved provider profiles for:
- bank CSV
- PayPal activity
- Stripe balance transactions
- Square transactions
- Etsy payment account
- manual CSV

These profiles are stored in D1 table `accounting_statement_provider_profiles` and surfaced in `/admin/accounting/`.

## Next template work
- Add sanitized sample headers for each provider.
- Add manual CSV templates for expenses, payouts, refunds, fees, and HST review.
- Add accountant export manifest templates once the export package is complete.

## Build 125 note

Build 125 keeps Amazon order/cost data private, adds admin review/apply controls for Amazon staging rows, records inventory cost history, expands reconciliation and journal guardrails, and adds local-intent SEO pages plus `sitemap.xml`. Keep schema files and active Markdown updated on every pass.

## Build 129 note

Amazon purchase rows should be imported to private D1 staging and reviewed before any costs are used in inventory, COGS, HST, or accountant export workflows.

## Build 131 note

Accounting templates remain public sample/template files only. Do not place real Amazon orders, bank statements, PayPal/Stripe exports, or customer/order transaction data in this public template folder.

## Build 155 maintenance note

This Markdown file was reviewed during the Build 155 pass. The active roadmap/schema/gaps documents carry the detailed implementation notes for custom request payment links, order conversion, marketplace export packs, proof filters, and post-fulfillment prompts.

## Build 158 documentation review

Reviewed during the catalog/media repair pass. No accounting-template or Amazon matching schema change was required for this pass, but the new `IMAGES.md` product-media checklist should be used before marketplace/image-heavy product exports.

## Build 160 — Catalog editor URL validation and publish image sync repair

- Fixed the Product Editor canonical URL field so relative site paths such as `/shop/product/?slug=desert-succulents-100` are accepted. The input is now text with helper guidance instead of browser `type=url` validation.
- Clarified External Listing URL: leave it blank for normal Devil n Dove shop products; only add a full `https://` Etsy/Facebook/marketplace URL when Sale Channel is Hybrid or External-only.
- Hardened update/create product image syncing so the featured image is also stored in `product_images` at sort order 0, gallery rows follow after it, duplicates are removed, and existing image rows/annotations are preserved when the URL already exists.
- Fixed Clear editor so the visual image cards and Product Media Workflow panel clear along with the form fields.
- Improved publish/approve readiness consistency by making the editor’s image fields and backend `product_images` rows agree before review actions run.
- No new D1 table is required in this pass; this is a code/data-sync behavior repair against the existing products, product_images, product_seo, and product_image_annotations tables.

Next recommended checks:
1. Edit a product with a relative canonical path and click Update Product.
2. Confirm External Listing URL is blank for normal onsite listings.
3. Save, reload, and confirm the first visual image is the featured image and appears in Product Media Workflow.
4. Run Approve/Publish; any blocker should now be a real readiness issue such as missing image role, missing SEO, missing price, or blocked public-use status.

## Build 161 — shop image/gallery, product detail JSON fallback, and catalog workspace split

- Repaired the public product detail page so an HTML fallback response from `/api/product-detail` no longer throws a raw `Unexpected token '<'` JSON error in the browser. The page now reads the response as text, detects HTML, and falls back to `/api/products` by slug when possible.
- Hardened `functions/api/product-detail.js` with a final JSON error wrapper so late D1/query failures return JSON instead of a static HTML error page.
- Extended `/api/products` to attach product image arrays from `product_images`, allowing shop cards to show a main image plus selectable thumbnail images.
- Updated the Shop product card UI so cards are more compact, show richer product details, and allow thumbnail clicks to change the main product image.
- CSS-polished the Shop “Browse by collection direction” area and the `/creations/` collection/trust grid so the layouts are less cramped and more mobile-safe.
- Split the oversized `/admin/catalog/` workflow into focused workspaces: Products & Publishing, Media & Product Images, and Tools & Supplies Inventory Operations.
- Added `/admin/catalog-media/` for media, image roles, image annotations, SEO, and product story work.
- Added `/admin/inventory-operations/` for tools, supplies, stock, product resource reservations, catalog sync, option sets, notifications, and app settings.
- Capped the Product Editor file picker to six selected uploads at a time while preserving existing product-image slots.
- Made the Product Media Workflow more compact by moving advanced crop/quality/scoring fields into a collapsible advanced section.

Next recommended steps: add a dedicated readiness-preview endpoint for product publishing blockers, add image health counters to the admin dashboard, and add live test notes after deploying Build 161.

## Build 162 — Shop/Creations CSS, Gift Page, and Inventory Image References

- Added `/gift-cards/` as a dedicated public gift-card page so the main shop no longer has the full gift-card form awkwardly placed between filters and products.
- Changed `/shop/` to show a compact gift-card callout that links to `/gift-cards/`.
- Repaired the contrast for the `/shop/` Browse by collection direction panel and the `/creations/` browse/filter/cards areas so light panels use dark readable text.
- Updated Tools & Supplies Inventory Operations to show a live visual image preview beside the Image URL field while keeping the URL editable.
- Updated the inventory list rows to show a larger thumbnail, the image URL link, and the source/Amazon URL link for easier visual reference.
- Added `/gift-cards/` to the sitemap. No D1 schema migration is required for this pass.


## Build 164 — Roadmap/Gaps Pass Completed

Completed from the requested next-20 pass:

1. Added inline readiness badges beside each product row in `/admin/catalog/`.

19. Added accountant export/evidence visibility notes for missing HST/GST evidence URLs.
20. Improved `/admin/mobile/` as a better mobile admin landing page by adding readiness, inventory operations, and missing accounting-state mount support.

### Build 164 schema/data notes

New tables or schema references added:

- `custom_order_stage_photos`
- `custom_candle_soap_product_specs`
- unique index `idx_custom_candle_soap_product_specs_product`
- marketplace export pack fields for image validation status/notes

No public page should have more than one H1; the sanity pass must keep checking this every build.
